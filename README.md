Report 2: Estimation of implicit dividends using the box spread strategy on option prices

Report 3: Comparison between binomial, Leisen-Reimer and Black-Scholes models 

Report 4: Computation and visualization of the Greeks under different market conditions, check of the volatility

Report 5: Application of Monte Carlo simulation to price various types of financial derivatives, focusing on 
          different option types under the Black-Scholes model. Geometric Brownian motion simulation.
